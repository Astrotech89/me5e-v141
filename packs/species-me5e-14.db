They have a powerful desire to advance and improve themselves and do so with such assertion that the normally staid Council species have been taken aback by their restlessness and relentless curiosity.</p>\n<h3><strong>New Horizons</strong></h3>\n<p>Human space exploration began in earnest in the late 21st century. In 2069 CE, Armstrong Outpost in Shackleton Crater on Luna was founded as humanity's first extraterrestrial settlement. In 2103, the European Space Agency established Lowell City in Eos Chasma on Mars, paving the way for additional settlements and scientific outposts throughout Sol. In 2148, human explorers on Mars uncovered a long-ruined Prothean observation post, with a surviving data cache that proved Protheans had studied Cro-Magnon humans millennia ago. Discovering information on a mass relay orbiting Pluto, explorers managed to open the Charon Relay and discovered it led to Arcturus.</p>\n<h3><strong>First Contact</strong></h3>\n<p>Humans first came to the attention of the galactic community after a brief but intense conflict with the turians, known by humans as the First Contact War. As a consequence of the Systems Alliance's swift and decisive action during the First Contact War, the Alliance became the representative and supranational governing body of humanity. Since then, humans have rapidly risen in prominence. Humanity continued to expand to unclaimed star systems on the edge of Citadel space, which eventually led to competition with the batarians.</p>\n<h3><strong>Systems Alliance</strong></h3>\n<p>The Systems Alliance holds sway over much of the human species, but not all fall under its banner. A few colonies on the fringes of known space are founded on principles of independence, and Earth still has nation-states that administer to their own territories. To the galaxy at large, though, nonhumans are always under the perception that Earth is a unified political entity represented by the Alliance.</p>\n<h3><strong>Galactic Relations</strong></h3>\n<p>The Systems Alliance has had an embassy on the Citadel since 2165. Many other species dislike humans' sudden ascendancy compared to their status as relative newcomers on the galactic stage. Some species feel that humanity is overly expansive in its colonization efforts and aggressive attempts to advance its position in galactic affairs.

The hanar homeworld, Kahje, has 90% ocean cover and orbits an energetic white star, resulting in a permanent blanket of clouds. Hanar are known for their strong religious beliefs regarding the Protheans, whom they call \"the Enkindlers\". Hanar are extremely polite, almost to a fault. They never refer to themselves in the first person with someone they know on a face name basis: to do so is considered egotistical. Instead, they refer to themselves as \"this one,\" or the impersonal \"it.\" Even when flustered or angry, a hanar will still maintain exquisite poise and will remain formal even with those it wishes dead.</p>\n<h3><strong>Enkindlers</strong></h3>\n<p>Due to the presence of Prothean ruins on Kahje, the hanar have developed a religion centered on the ancient species, calling them the \"Enkindlers\". The hanar practice a religious holiday called Nyahir or \"First Cresting Bloom\" which lasts a full thirteen days and revolves around celebrating the gift of speech, which they attribute to having come from the Enkindlers. It is a mixture of contemplation and competition, with the faithful engaged in stylized debates, poetry duels, and other traditional hanar art forms. The winners of these events have their names inscribed in bio-luminescence on the side of Mount Vassla, an underwater volcano at the heart of one of the oldest Prothean ruins on Kahje.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Compact</strong></h3>\n<p>Several hundred years ago, the hanar made contact with the drell on their nearby homeworld of Rakhana. Drell society was quickly collapsing due to overpopulation and warring over scarce resources, so the hanar rescued several hundred thousand drell and brought them to Kahje, where they integrated into hanar society with the remaining drell dying out. Now the drell serve as a client species of the hanar, and although to outside observers the relationship can be construed as a form of slavery, the reality is very different. Drell have integrated with every level of hanar society, and most consider it an honor to serve a hanar family in a tradition referred to as the Compact. Many drell become unofficial members of the family, and some even earn the privilege to learn their masters' \"soul names\".</p>\n<h3><strong>Language of Lights</strong></h3>\n<p>The hanar communicate using sophisticated patterns of bioluminescence and speak with scrupulous precision and extreme politeness. Other species need machine assistance to translate, though many drell apply genetic modification to their eyes in order to perceive higher frequency flashes which allows them to understand the hanar. Most hanar take offense at improper language and must take special courses to unlearn this tendency if they expect to deal with other species.</p>\n<h3><strong>Hanar Names</strong></h3>\n<p>The hanar have two names, a \"face name\" and a \"soul name.\" The face name is used as a general label for use by strangers and acquaintances.

They also have at least three stomachs.</p>\n<h3><strong>Language of Smells and Sight</strong></h3>\n<p>Elcor speech is heard by most species as a flat, ponderous monotone. Among themselves, scent, extremely slight body movements, and subvocalized infrasound convey shades of meaning that make a human smile seem as subtle as a fireworks display. Since their subtlety can lead to misunderstandings with other species, the elcor prefix all their dialog with non-elcor with an emotive statement to clarify their tone.</p>\n<h3><strong>Migratory Nature</strong></h3>\n<p>Prehistoric elcor traveled across Dekuuna in large tribal groups. As their civilizations grew, they kept their migratory nature and established twin capitals on their homeworld, one for the wet season and one for the dry season. However, their migration is limited to a single planet as most elcor find the confines of space travel very uncomfortable.</p>\n<h3><strong>Living Tanks</strong></h3>\n<p>Because of their slow, conservative psyches, elcor are not suitable for making the spur-of-the-moment decisions necessary in combat situations. Instead, they rely on sophisticated VI combat systems. While easy targets, their durable hide allows them to shrug off most incoming fire. Elcor warriors use their broad shoulders as a mount for weaponry and their VI as a targeting mechanism. Some elcor are equipped with mass-accelerator cannons, the same weapons typically mounted on military vehicles.</p>\n<h3><strong>Elcor Names</strong></h3>\n<p>Elcor do not have gender-binary names because their gender is discerned through smell.

Their skin is infused with a venom mild enough to be served in drinks and may cause mild hallucinations on oral contact. Drell also possess eidetic memory, an adaptation to a world where they must remember the location of every necessary resource across vast distances. The memories are so strong that an external stimulus can trigger a powerful memory recall and these recalls are so vivid and detailed that some drell may mistake it for reality.</p>\n<h3><strong>Homeworld Lost</strong></h3>\n<p>The drell ancestors emerged from dry, rocky deserts on the barren world of Rakhana. Eight centuries ago, the already-arid drell homeworld began its swift descent into lifelessness due to disastrous industrial expansion. At the time, the drell lacked interstellar flight capacity, and with their population bursting at eleven billion, they faced certain doom.</p>\n<p>It was around the 1980s CE that the hanar made first contact with the drell species. In the following ten years, the hanar would transport a total of 375,000 drell to the hanar homeworld, Kahje. The remaining billions left on Rakhana would perish on their dying planet, warring against each other for diminishing resources.</p>\n<h3><strong>Servants of the Hanar</strong></h3>\n<p>The debt of gratitude that the drell owe the hanar is referred to as the Compact, which the drell fulfill by taking on tasks that the hanar find difficult, such as combat. Any drell may refuse to serve, but as being requested to serve is a great honor, few turn down the offer. Some drell grow a close, personal relationship with the hanar, so much so that the hanar will even tell the drell their \"soul name\". Drell have adapted to communication with hanar by getting implants in their eyes to allow them to observe the bioluminescence the hanar use for communication.</p>\n<h3><strong>Devout</strong></h3>\n<p>Most drell are deeply religious, believing that they have souls separate from their bodies. They see death as a departure from the body, and they also state that a person's body and soul form a Whole. When the soul is traumatized or otherwise disrupted, or the body is ill or injured, a person is no longer Whole. They also believe that their body can be directed as a separate entity from themselves, thus, some drell take no responsibility when executing an order given by the hanar even if the order is an assassination.</p>\n<p>The religion includes at least three gods which drell often pray to for guidance and protection:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Amonkira, Lord of Hunters</li>\n<li>Arashu, Goddess of Motherhood and Protection</li>\n<li>Kalahira, Goddess of Oceans and Afterlife.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Drell Names</strong></h3>\n<p>Drell use given and family names.</p>\n<p>Male Names: Chas, Drino, Hite, Hoskim, Lofo, Massa, Neta, Nitos, Ruyim, Tako, Tayu, Thane, Tumil, Yesit</p>\n<p>Female Names: Ares, Arina, Ehanen, Ekire, Eshesnu, Inashe, Inukmel, Itheyl, Odrinne, Oshane, Ulanten, Uthoru</p>\n<p>Family Names: Dreis, Feun, Futos, Keas, Krios, Kuun, Mout, Soas, Shuit, Suul, Thatos, Yeos</p>\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></p>\n<p>+2 Dexterity, +1 Wisdom</p>\n<p><strong>Age</strong></p>\n<p>Drell have slightly shorter lifespans of 85 years, on average.

The asari resemble female humans with blue or purple skin and a crest of rigid tentacles in place of hair. Despite their feminine appearance, asari have little use for gender or gender roles, though they often use female pronouns and gendered language. They possess a unique method of reproduction initiated by a \"mind meld\" which links the asari's nervous system with a partner-even one of a different species-to randomize genes to create asari offspring. Asari have an innate biotic ability and don't require a biotic implant to manipulate mass effect fields.</p>\n<h3><strong>Unmatched Patience</strong></h3>\n<p>Because of their long lifespan, asari tend to have a \"long view\" not common in other species. When they encounter a new species or situation, the asari are more comfortable with an extended period of passive observation and study than immediate action. They invite new species of advanced development to join the galactic community, knowing that their ideals and beliefs will inevitably influence the existing culture.</p>\n<h3><strong>Mothers of the Galaxy</strong></h3>\n<p>Asari reproduction is very different from other forms of sexual reproduction. When a meld for reproduction is initiated, the asari accesses her partner's genes and subconsciously uses them as an algorithmic seed to remap genes into a unique set of DNA. The offspring resulting from such interspecies pairings are always asari as no DNA is taken from the partner. Instead, the asari uses the meld to explore her partner's genetic heritage and pass desirable traits on to any offspring and as a \"map\" to randomize the genes of the offspring.</p>\n<p>Asari believe that their offspring acquire the best qualities of the \"father\" from the melded genes. Therefore, they frown upon intraspecies conception, since genetic traits and cultural insight is gained from mating outside their species, so it's considered wasteful for asari to reproduce together. The results of such unions are occasionally referred to as \"purebloods\", a great insult among contemporary asari. A rare genetic defect known as Ardat-Yakshi, which makes asari destroy the partner's mind during melding, occurs much more frequently among the daughters of purebloods.</p>\n<h3><strong>Maiden, Matron, Matriarch</strong></h3>\n<p>Asari pass through three climacteric life stages, marked by biochemical and physiological changes. The Maiden stage begins at puberty and is marked by the drive to explore and experience. Most young asari are curious and restless, and it is not uncommon for many to try their hand at dancing in bars or working as mercenaries during this time. The Matron stage of life begins around the age of 350, though it can be triggered earlier if the individual melds frequently. This period is marked by a desire to settle in one area and raise children. The Matriarch stage begins around 700 years of age, or earlier if the individual melds rarely. Matriarchs become active in their community as sages and councilors, dispensing wisdom from centuries of experience. Their knowledge and guidance may be one reason why Matriarchs are rarely seen outside asari space. However, each stage can be started whenever an asari feels that she has reached the correct level of maturity.</p>\n<h3><strong>Asari Names</strong></h3>\n<p>Asari are given a personal name by their parents and take the surname of their mothers, even if the child has 2 asari parents. Outside of asari communities, they normally do not use their surnames and prefer to introduce themselves with their personal name only.

Alternatively, you may use your action to direct questions at the target creature to naturally shape the course of its thoughts.</p>\n<p>Mind meld lasts 1 minute. An unwilling creature makes another Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a successful save, the meld ends.

Effective caste status can be bought on an ongoing basis like a subscription service, allowing the buyer to worm their way into the elite circles of batarian society given enough funds. Casting aspersions on the monetary worth of a social better is considered a serious insult. Batarians strongly believe that species with fewer than four eyes are less intelligent; they often gain the upper hand in interspecies arguments because other species find it difficult to know which eyes to focus on when speaking to them.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Hegemony</strong></h3>\n<p>Their government, known as the Batarian Hegemony, is hostile to the Systems Alliance (human government), but beneath the notice of the powerful Council species. Humans receive the brunt of batarians' antagonism in the form of scams, slave raids, and terrorist attacks, incidents which the Hegemony covertly supports but is always quick to publicly distance itself from. Given the batarian government's oppressive nature, it is speculated their supreme leadership is autocratic or totalitarian in nature, although the batarian homeworld of Khar'shan remains divided into various competing nation-states.</p>\n<h3><strong>Batarian Names</strong></h3>\n<p>Like humans, batarian names consist of a given name and family name.</p>\n<p>Male Names: Afothor, Carn, Dhapo, Drathar, Ecray, Eporn, Irorok, Khamak, Okorem, Prathan, Sato, Sonk, Uderlak</p>\n<p>Female Names: Apenine, Adrechia, Banim, Della, Erakis, Famisa, Fophe, Igosin, Iraphi, Kranine, Krathe, Okhefin, Pravile, Ramye</p>\n<p>Family Names: Can'dabar, Das'codah, Dhen'gess, Dran'fapos, Ghapsacan, Gronnopos, Kasbovran, Khognalak, Krak'gork, Pec'bawen, Sanrowar</p>\n<h2><strong>Traits</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></p>\n<p>+1 to all ability scores</p>\n<p><strong>Age</strong></p>\n<p>Batarians age at about the same rate as humans, though many do not live past 100 due to their caustic and dangerous lifestyles.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong></p>\n<p>Because of the tenets of Hegemony, batarians tend to be lawful evil, although there are outliers on the moral spectrum.</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong></p>\n<p>Batarian bodies are similar to humans, with the exception of a large forehead to accommodate their additional four eyes, making them about 15cm (6\") taller.

They have a powerful desire to advance and improve themselves and do so with such assertion that the normally staid Council species have been taken aback by their restlessness and relentless curiosity.</p>\n<h3><strong>New Horizons</strong></h3>\n<p>Human space exploration began in earnest in the late 21st century. In 2069 CE, Armstrong Outpost in Shackleton Crater on Luna was founded as humanity's first extraterrestrial settlement. In 2103, the European Space Agency established Lowell City in Eos Chasma on Mars, paving the way for additional settlements and scientific outposts throughout Sol. In 2148, human explorers on Mars uncovered a long-ruined Prothean observation post, with a surviving data cache that proved Protheans had studied Cro-Magnon humans millennia ago. Discovering information on a mass relay orbiting Pluto, explorers managed to open the Charon Relay and discovered it led to Arcturus.</p>\n<h3><strong>First Contact</strong></h3>\n<p>Humans first came to the attention of the galactic community after a brief but intense conflict with the turians, known by humans as the First Contact War. As a consequence of the Systems Alliance's swift and decisive action during the First Contact War, the Alliance became the representative and supranational governing body of humanity. Since then, humans have rapidly risen in prominence. Humanity continued to expand to unclaimed star systems on the edge of Citadel space, which eventually led to competition with the batarians.</p>\n<h3><strong>Systems Alliance</strong></h3>\n<p>The Systems Alliance holds sway over much of the human species, but not all fall under its banner. A few colonies on the fringes of known space are founded on principles of independence, and Earth still has nation-states that administer to their own territories. To the galaxy at large, though, nonhumans are always under the perception that Earth is a unified political entity represented by the Alliance.</p>\n<h3><strong>Galactic Relations</strong></h3>\n<p>The Systems Alliance has had an embassy on the Citadel since 2165. Many other species dislike humans' sudden ascendancy compared to their status as relative newcomers on the galactic stage. Some species feel that humanity is overly expansive in its colonization efforts and aggressive attempts to advance its position in galactic affairs.

They are the only known extant sapient species native to the Heleus Cluster of the Andromeda galaxy, and arose on the planet Havarl.

If he wishes to be considered for breeding, he must take the Rite of Honor. When facing a new enemy, the Rite of Firsts is invoked.</p>\n<p>A krogan clan also has a shaman, who has endured the Rite of Insight. The rituals endured by a shaman are lengthy and torturous; most krogan who attempt the rite perish. Those who survive become the most respected member of their clan and are rarely challenged. The shaman is a clan's spiritual leader and guide and is believed to see into the spirit world itself.</p>\n<h3><strong>Krogan Names</strong></h3>\n<p>Krogan names are fairly simple: a clan name followed by a given name, which is normally bestowed upon them by their father.</p>\n<p>Male Names: Archuk, Brood, Charr, Drax, Fortak, Grunt, Guld, Jarrod Nax, Okeer, Skarr, Strux, Uvenk, Wreav, Wrex</p>\n<p>Female Names: Bakara, Chormi, Derge, Hazka, Jonde Kesh, Khorga, Kherake, Morda, Tegash, Vruxa, Zrogoga</p>\n<p>Clan Names: Garbon, Gatatog, Jorgal, Khutarum, Nakmor, Srarkan, Traash, Urdnot, Verbok, Weryloc, Wudark</p>\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></p>\n<p>+2 Constitution, +1 Strength</p>\n<p><strong>Age</strong></p>\n<p>Krogan can live well over a thousand years due to their natural hardiness.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong></p>\n<p>Krogan are highly predisposed towards chaos, as their culture is violent, selfish, and brutal. While evil is more common among krogan, those of good and neutral alignments do exist among them. Good krogan especially find it difficult to thrive in Tuchanka and krogan society.</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong></p>\n<p>Krogan stand at over 2 meters tall (~7') and weigh close to 400 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong></p>\n<p>Your speed is not reduced by wearing armor. Your base walking speed is 12 meters.</p>\n<p><strong>Blood Rage</strong></p>\n<p>When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can choose to not fall unconscious and enter a blood rage instead. When you enter your blood rage, you lose concentration on any powers you are maintaining.</p>\n<p>The blood rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you regain hit points or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature or taken damage since the end of your last turn.</p>\n<p>For the duration, you are immune to being charmed or frightened and the only Action you may take is either Attack or Dash. You continue to make death saving throws as normal and damage causes death saving throw failures. However, no amount of success or failures cause you to stabilize or die until blood rage ends. Additionally, when you would receive a death saving throw success you may, instead, remove a death saving throw failure, or vice versa.</p>\n<p>When blood rage ends, if you have four or more death saving throw failures, you die. Otherwise, you fall unconscious.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p><strong>Natural Armor</strong></p>\n<p>When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Constitution modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A held shield’s benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.</p>\n<p><strong>Nutrient Hump</strong></p>\n<p>Your large shoulder humps store fluids and nutrients, enabling you to survive extended periods without food or water. You can go twice as long without food or water before you suffer exhaustion.</p>\n<p><strong>Powerful Build</strong></p>\n<p>You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>\n<p><strong>Thick Frontal Plate</strong></p>\n<p>Your frontal plate is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Constitution modifier, instead of the damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>\n<p><strong>Toughness</strong></p>\n<p>Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.</p>\n<h2>Tank-Bred</h2>\n<p>Tank-bred krogan were developed by the warlord Okeer, who was originally investigating the genophage. However, Okeer gradually became obsessed with his work and realized that surviving the genophage had become the only benchmark for a good krogan, which was weakening the species as a whole. He decided to produce a genetically pure, superior krogan—a super soldier—and poured all his efforts into his experiments, even seeking help from the Collectors.</p>\n<p>As a tank-bred krogan, you may be a prototype from Okeer’s research or developed in another lab setting that branched off of Okeer’s research.</p>\n<p>If you would like to play a Tankbred Krogan, gain the following traits in addition to all Krogan traits.</p>\n<p><strong>Blind Rage</strong></p>\n<p>Whenever you have less than half your hit points remaining and suffer damage to your hit points, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or enter a blind rage, immediately losing concentration on any powers you are maintaining. You must also make the saving throw whenever you choose to enter your blood rage.</p>\n<p>While in a blind rage, you must use your action and any potential bonus actions or reactions each round to attack the creature nearest to you. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after you kill your current target. If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random.</p>\n<p>You are in a blind range until you die, are incapacitated, or start your turn with no creatures within 24 meters of you that you can see or hear.</p>\n<p><strong>Imprinted Enemies</strong></p>\n<p>Your tank imprints have also imparted tactics and knowledge against specific species. Choose two species to be your imprinted enemies.</p>\n<p>You have advantage on Intelligence checks to recall information about your imprinted enemies.</p>\n<p>The first time on each of your turns that you hit a creature of your imprinted enemies’ species with a weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon’s damage dice an additional time and add it as extra damage of the weapon’s damage type.</p>\n<p><strong>Tank Imprints</strong></p>\n<p>The tank has imparted knowledge into you via imprints. You gain proficiency with one weapon of your choice, one skill of your choice, and one tool of your choice.</p>\n<p> </p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Krogan","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"gYZLWNR8CFcvb2eO":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.xCCAErpAXnbVuC37"}}}

They are brutal conquerors from an unknown area of Andromeda beyond the borders of the Heleus Cluster. Seemingly genderless, they prize physical supremacy and genetic dominance, assimilating conquered peoples. The kett believe their species is superior to all others, and as such, the conquered have two fates: either become Exalted, altered on a genetic level to become kett, or enslaved for the glory of the empire.</p>\n<h3 data-v-64729cc4>Threat from the Void</h3>\n<p data-v-64729cc4>The kett are not native to the Heleus Cluster, which they call Sector 1-19-NYKZ, and began invading it in 2744. When the angara encountered them, the kett lured them into a false sense of security with gifts and offers of friendship, before kidnapping their leadership and providing information which provoked arguments between angaran worlds. Little is known about how large the Kett empire truly is, but the advance on the Heleus Cluster represents only a portion of their invading force.</p>\n<h3 data-v-64729cc4>Masters of Bioengineering</h3>\n<p data-v-64729cc4>The kett possess technology that is comparable in advancement to the Andromeda Initiative, but have an unparalleled mastery of biotechnology and medical technology. Bio-engineered components are used in all of their machines and devices.

It is speculated that exaltation arose long ago in kett history when their genetics reached a point of stagnation, leaving the species unable to breed through natural means. The kett began adding beneficial genes from other species into their own genome in order to continually improve themselves, which they refer to as harmonization. Kett mastery over genetic manipulation enabled them to develop a serum to rapidly convert other species into obedient kett, which became the basis for exaltation.</p>\n<p data-v-64729cc4>Kett biology retains traits taken from many other species. One such trait is that kett can survive for limited periods in inhospitable environments without protective suits, including vacuum. However, nothing from the original species' body is left: a kett exalted from an angara, for example, only has traces of angaran genome remaining. Internal scans show kett organs, not angaran ones. They are physically kett, for all intents and purposes, and exaltation appears to be permanent and irreversible thus far.</p>\n<p data-v-64729cc4>The kett revere exaltation as a sacred ritual, believing that the species selected to undergo exaltation are ascending to greatness while helping the kett do the same. These subjugated species are initially called \"Chosen\", and may later advance to higher tiers with the kett hierarchy, such as \"Anointed\".</p>\n<h3 data-v-64729cc4>Kett Names</h3>\n<p data-v-64729cc4>Kett are mostly known through titles related to their position in society.

The Protheans arose from a single planet and developed an immense galaxy-wide empire encompassing many other spacefaring species. Not much is known about them, but many of their artifacts, ruins and technology have apparently survived the ages.</p>\n<h3 data-v-64729cc4>Ancient Empire</h3>\n<p data-v-64729cc4>After achieving spaceflight, the Protheans discovered the ruins of a previous spacefaring species, the inusannon, and from those ruins learned about mass effect physics and developed FTL technology. The Protheans would expand throughout the galaxy with the help of the mass relay network and make the Citadel their capital.</p>\n<p data-v-64729cc4>Early in their development, the Protheans encountered a hostile machine intelligence which threatened to overwhelm them. To defeat the machines, the Protheans decided to unite all of the galaxy's sentient organic life under their empire.

They were caught completely off-guard by the scale and rapidity of the assault. The Reapers entered the galaxy through the Citadel, instantly decapitating the Protheans' government and disrupting the mass relay network, isolating Prothean systems from one another. The Protheans' greatest strength, their unified empire, proved to be their downfall.</p>\n<h3 data-v-64729cc4>Stasis</h3>\n<p data-v-64729cc4>In a desperate attempt to survive the Reaper invasion, the Protheans built massive, hidden stasis facilities that could hold hundreds of thousands of stasis pods. Some facilities were found by Reaper agents or betrayed by indoctrinated Protheans. Unfortunately, the facilities that remained hidden faced another challenge: a finite power source. The VI's left to control these facilities began systematically cutting power to non-essential staff to conserve energy. 50,000 years later, the number of active pods in each facility might be less than a dozen and without knowing the location of these hidden bunkers, it's impossible to know how many Protheans have survived.</p>\n<h3 data-v-64729cc4>All Eyes on You</h3>\n<p data-v-64729cc4>As a Prothean, you constantly attract the attention of other species.

You can use your exoskeleton to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A held shield’s benefits apply as normal while you use your natural exoskeleton.</p>\n<p><strong>Seeker Swarm</strong></p>\n<p>As an action, you call three seeker swarms that orbit around you. The swarms remain for 1 hour or until you dismiss them as a bonus action. While active, you may use a bonus action to expend one to three swarms that hit a creature of your choice within 60 meters. A swarm deals 1d4 + 1 necrotic damage to its target and detonates any primed condition (this damage bypasses shields). If you expend more than one swarm, they all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.</p>\n<p>Once you use this feature, you must take a long rest before using it again.</p>\n<p><strong>Wings</strong></p>\n<p>You have fully developed wings that allow you to fly over short distances. You gain a flying speed of 12 meters (40 ft) but if you end your movement in the air, you fall to the ground at the end of your turn.</p>\n<p>Additionally, whenever you suffer falling damage you only suffer half the amount.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"Awakened Collector","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"AcIkxpOFBtjLXuSn":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.qa2uV7ECIVF8xGcO"}},"_id":"rMaD9PL8V5n16ap1"}
{"name":"Quarian","type":"feat","img":"modules/ME5e-FoundryVTT/assets/artwork/playable/Quarian.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Forced out of their homeland by sapient constructs of their own creation, quarian are exiled nomads that now sail the seas in search of a new homeland.</p>\n<h3><strong>Exotic Fashion</strong></h3>\n<p>The enviro-suits have moved beyond function, however, and into their culture. A quarian is rarely, if ever, seen without their suit and helmet, and when they return from their Pilgrimage as adults, they are expected to modify their suit to fit their personal reflection of their status as a productive member of the Flotilla.</p>\n<h3><strong>Exiles of their Own Creations</strong></h3>\n<p>Quarians have a long and deep history with creating constructs known as \"Geth,\" meaning \"Servant of the People\". These constructs were built to serve and protect the quarians, and most quarian families had at least one servant, while the quarian military consisted of these autonomous beings.</p>\n<p>The quarians sought to constantly improve their creation with more advanced virtual intelligence so they could complete increasingly complex tasks. These improvements lead to the geth's sapience and they began to question their masters. The quarians attempted to exterminate them, but after forming so much dependence on the geth, the quarians were swiftly defeated. With many exterminated, the remaining quarians fled their homeland of Rannoch.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cybernetic Improvements</strong></h3>\n<p>Though the quarians have abandoned their long history of construct and VI creation, they put their knowledge of engineering and technology into their own bodies to augment themselves. These augments are crafted by artisans who have descended from or studied under those who originally worked with or programmed the geth. The implants themselves are normally small, no larger than the size of a palm, and when properly inserted give the quarian enhanced ability compared to those without. A quarian chooses an augment before they leave for the Pilgrimage, and the implantation of the device is part of their sending off ceremony.</p>\n<h3><strong>Migrant Fleet</strong></h3>\n<p>The nomads travel together in a collective of ships known as the Flotilla or the Migrant Fleet and consists of those who escaped death by the geth. The Flotilla contains over fifty thousand vessels collectively that travel the galaxy strip-mining and harvesting resource to keep the fleet afloat. Some ships decide to depart the fleet to pursue their own goals, but normally return to the fleet.</p>\n<p>When young quarians rejoin the Flotilla after their Pilgrimage, they are expected to join the crew of another vessel to ensure genetic diversity of an already small population.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Pilgrimage</strong></h3>\n<p>During quarian adolescence, they are subjected to a rite of passage known as the Pilgrimage. When young adulthood is reached, quarians are expected to leave the Migrant Fleet and experience life outside of their culture. To rejoin the Flotilla, the young quarians must bear a gift to the captain of a new vessel. This gift can be tangible, such as resources, or intangible such as information. Most quarian operatives are those on their pilgrimage, though there are those who decide never to return to the Migrant Fleet or those who were rejected from rejoining.</p>\n<h3><strong>Quarian Names</strong></h3>\n<p>Quarian names are composed of three parts: the quarian's given name and family name separated by an apostrophe, and the name of their vessel preceeded by a title - \"nar\" to denote their birth ship and \"vas\" to denote their post-pilgrimage ship. For example, nar Rayya or vas Neema.</p>\n<p>Male Names: Golo, Han, Hilo, Kal, Kar, Keenah, Kenn, Lemm, Les, Prazza, Rael, Seeto, Shio, Veetor, Ysin, Zaal, Zer</p>\n<p>Female Names: Ceni, Daro, Elan, Feda, Jura, Laele, Lia, Meeri, Minn, Reen, Saesa, Shala, Shuni, Tali, Yosi, Zohe,</p>\n<p>Family Names: Breizah, Dannah, Gazu, Gerral, Hodda, Jaa, Koris, Leth, Mal, Mekk, Nara, Raan, Reegar, Shaal, Shiya, Vael, Xen, Zorah</p>\n<p>Vessel Names: Honorata, Idenna, Moreh, Neema, Novarra, Qwib Qwib, Rayya, Tesleya, Tonbay, Ulnay, Usela</p>\n<h2>Traits</h2>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></p>\n<p>+1 Intelligence, +1 Constitution</p>\n<p><strong>Age</strong></p>\n<p>Quarians have lifespans similar to humans.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong></p>\n<p>The proximity and longstanding traditions of the Migrant Fleet make Quarians very lawful as a species, occasionally drifting toward neutral. Morality can vary but tends towards neutral or good, as evil quarians are typically exiled from the Flotilla.</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong></p>\n<p>Quarians have builds similar to humans.

If you are the victim of a critical hit that deals piercing or slashing damage, your suit becomes breached. For each hour in which you have a breach in your suit, you suffer one level of exhaustion. For each hour you spend outside of your suit if not in a compatible environment, suffer 3 levels of exhaustion.</p>\n<p>As an action, you may spend 1 omni-gel to seal your suit. You have 3 omni-gel as part of your starting equipment.</p>\n<h2>Cybernetic Augmentation</h2>\n<p>Along with their suits, quarians also have extensive cybernetic augmentations integrated into their bodies. When receiving your augmentations, you can choose from the following specializations.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Cerebral</strong></h3>\n<p>Cerebral implants are embedded in the brains of quarian to enhance mental prowess and to protect against mind-altering effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase</strong></p>\n<p>+1 Intelligence</p>\n<p><strong>Mind Shielding Unit</strong></p>\n<p>You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened and your mind cannot be read by an asari's mind meld.</p>\n<p><strong>Scientific Aptitude</strong></p>\n<p>You gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Electronics, Engineering, History, Investigation, or Science.</p>\n<p><strong>Muscular</strong></p>\n<p>Muscular augments are implants placed strategically at the shoulders and hips to direct pulses of adrenaline through muscle fibers, allowing for bursts of speed, strength, and flexibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Burst of Speed</strong></p>\n<p>When you move on your turn in combat, you can double your speed until the end of the turn.
