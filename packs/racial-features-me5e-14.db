Your emitter is a device that houses the Hologram’s personality and memories, and acts as the “true body” of the Hologram. It is a Tiny device that has 10 AC and a number of hit points equal to twice your proficiency bonus. The emitter has no means of mobility, thus has a walking speed of 0. It has an array of sensory inputs and acts as “you” when determining what you can see or hear.</p>\n<p data-v-64729cc4>Your projection is a hard-light construct that physically interacts with the world. The projection has a base walking speed of 12 meters and gains all the benefits of your selected class. When summoned, the projection can equip weapons and armor, use actions, cast powers, and interact with objects. Whenever the projection is recalled or dissipated, it drops any weapons or armor in its location.</p>\n<p data-v-64729cc4>Your projection and emitter have separate health pools. Whenever you recover hit points, you can distribute the amount recovered between either pool. If the projection is reduced to 0 hit points, it dissipates. If the emitter is reduced to 0 hit points, you make death saving throws as normal.</p>\n<p data-v-64729cc4>Whenever your projection is in the same space as your emitter, it can store the emitter within its hard-light shell as a free action. While stored in this way, your emitter benefits from full cover and is immune to damage.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"ME5e","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"AI (Hologram)","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"yArTY9skcfmeWe1f":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.H1uOjdhyoUBmCBgl"}}}
