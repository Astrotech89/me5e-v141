* Compendium content from ME5e.

## Content
* 3 Character Sheet Themes:
    * ME5e
    * Paragon
    * Renegade
* Compendiums:
    * Bestiary
    * Backgrounds
    * Classes (with subclasses)
    * Class Features (with subclass features)
    * Feats
    * Item Catalogue (with: armor, weapons, weapon mods, armor mods, grenades, programs, and more)
    * Racial Features
    * Spells
    * Vehicles

(NOTE: Races from ME5e are copyright infringing and will not be included in this module. Similarly, any copyright infringing entries have been left out of the Bestiary and will not be added.)

## Limitations
Due to current limitations and a limited amount of time, there is no 'click to roll' function for the custom skill of Vehicle Handling. Instead, the place next to Vehicle Handling that says 'undefined' upon creating a new character sheet is a text box that will allow for manual tracking of what the modifier should be. Delete the 'undefined' text and replace with with whatever the modifier should be, positive or negative.

This will also serve to add resources and links

Not sure if this helps, but there's this:
https://github.com/queryluke/masseffect-5e/tree/master/assets/images
I think nearly all (if not every) image used in the bestiary/weapons/mods/etc are direct links from the mass effect wiki, not stored locally by us
Ah, here's what you want:
https://github.com/queryluke/masseffect-5e-data/tree/master/data
For example, if you click into /armor from there, you can find a list of armor items. Here's an example one:
https://github.com/queryluke/masseffect-5e-data/blob/master/data/armor/andromeda-elite-helmet.md

Notice the wikia link in the image field. Unfortunately you'd need to go into them link by link and download / copy the reference... Or possibly write a script, depending on what you need.
Let me know if that helps @Astrotech
I think there was a google folder of tokens actually
